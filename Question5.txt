An issue that could arise if a robot is assigned a new task right after he finishes his previous task is that the robot could immediately go in again and pick up the same tools again and not allow the other robots to finish their task. A way to fix this could be to use an std::atomic<int> variable which increments each time the robots finish a task and then have a control variable which signals the robots once the counter reaches multiples of 5 in order to communicate that the robots can go in again and start their second tasks once all the robots are done with their first task. This would also encompass if statements.
