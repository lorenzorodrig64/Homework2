This is actually an issue I faced before when coding the question. I saw that the ATC controller was falling asleep when he was not supposed to and ultimately, my code ended up deadlocked. A way to prevent these deadlocks from happening is to have proper use of condition variables. For example, not only should you use a condition variable to wake up the ATC, but also for managing the queue of the airplanes waiting to land and entering the traffic pattern.
